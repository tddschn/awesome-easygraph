## GitHub Actions
- [tddschn/install-easygraph](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-easygraph) - builds and installs the easygraph from source, on ubuntu-latest and macos-latest.
- [tddschn/easygraph-bench][eg-bench-actions] - Benchmarking easygraph (Python / C++) and networkx, fork the repo to use. Not recommended due to the uncertainty of hardware used for hosted GitHub Actions.

## Analysis
- [tddschn/easygraph-function-time-complexities][eg-time-complexity] - Time Complexities of EasyGraph Functions
- [tddschn/networkx-easygraph-comparison][eg-nx-comparison] - Comparison of EasyGraph and NetworkX (a bit outdated)
